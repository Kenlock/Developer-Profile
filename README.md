This is a Google Chrome extension that deletes browser data when all windows in
a profile are closed.  It is best used in a profile that was specifically
created for web development.

It was created in response to [crbug.com/376788](http://crbug.com/376788): *devtools settings are ignored/reset in Incognito mode*


## License

You may use this extension as long as you agree to not get mad at anyone
besides yourself, and maybe your parents, when this extension does what is
described.

You may reuse the code in any way you see fit. It's not like I invented `if`
statements.
